## ✨ How to use it

Once the sources are downloaded, make sure you have a decent NodeJS version. To compile & start the project, navigate in the root of the project and type.

```bash
$ npm i 
$ npm run dev
$ 
// OR via Yarn
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

Once the above commands are executed, the app should run in the browser `localhost:8080`. The Dark-MOde switcher is positioned in the sidebar. 
`Dark mode` is implemented by adding the `dark-theme` class to the body element. The current design mode is stored in the browser's local storage.

> Customization: Update styles saved in the `/src/assets/css/dark-mode.css` file
